# wine-quality-pridiction
machine learning project
## Overview

This repository contains a Wine Quality Prediction project that aims to predict the quality of red wines based on various chemical properties. The dataset used for this project is available in the `winequality.csv` file. This README file provides an overview of the project, instructions on how to reproduce the analysis, and details about the project structure.

## Project Description

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can predict the quality of wines based on their chemical characteristics. The dataset contains information about various attributes of wines, such as acidity, pH, alcohol content, and more. We will use this data to train and evaluate different machine learning models to predict the wine quality on a scale from 0 to 10.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `winequality.csv`: This CSV file contains the dataset with wine attributes and quality ratings.

- `6.Red Wine Quality Prediction.ipynb`: This Jupyter Notebook file contains the Python code for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
